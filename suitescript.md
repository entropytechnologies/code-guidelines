# JavaScript Style Guide

## Javascript
As Suitescript is plainly a dialect of Javascript using Netsuite's Suitescript APIs, our Javascript guidelines apply to Suitescript as well.
Consider this file as an extension of the Javascript, applicable only when working within Netsuite specific code.

## Suitescript Version
* We will collectively stick, whenever possible to Suitescript 2.1 version.
* We will only fallback to Suitescript 2.0 if we encounter any error, bug, inconsistency or unwanted behaviour using version 2.1.
* Under no conditions we will ever default to Suitescript 1.0 in new code.
* We are only allowed to use Suitescript 1.0 if modifying an existing script originally built with 1.0

## Typescript Adoption
As Typescript becomes ever more an industry standard. We are committed and encouraged to progressively adopt Typescript in our Suitescript code as far as the current
tools and ecosystem support it. There have been recent improvements in that area, although, official support from Netsuite is as far as we know, still in the works.
Typescript is not a hard requirement for new script created to this date, but it could certainly become a requirement in the future.
